# What I Learned
This project gave me the chance to really strengthen my understanding of Flexbox and CSS Grid while building out a full dashboard layout. I learned how to break down a complex design into smaller, manageable pieces and then bring them together step by step to form a cohesive layout. Using grid and flex in combination helped me see the best use cases for each, whether it was structuring the overall page or aligning content within sections. Overall, this project helped me grow more confident in translating designs into clean, well-structured code.
